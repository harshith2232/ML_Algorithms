Regression is basically a predictive modelling technique.

Typical definition:
            A technique for determining the statistical relationship between two or more variables where a change
            in a dependent variable is associated with, and depends on, a change in one or more independent variables.
Types of regressions:
            linear, polynomial, logistic(kind of classification)
            
 codes for all different types of regressions using sklearn are published in this directory.
