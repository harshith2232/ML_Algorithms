This directory consists of various data preprocesing startegies using pandas, numpy and sklearn libraries in python.


• Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm.
• Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis.
   
 Need of Data Preprocessing:
• For achieving better results from the applied model in Machine Learning projects the format of the data has to be in a proper manner.
• Some specified Machine Learning model needs information in a specified format, for example, Random Forest algorithm does not support null values, therefore to execute random forest algorithm null values have to be managed from the original raw data set.
• Another aspect is that data set should be formatted in such a way that more than one Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms are executed in one data set, and best out of them is chosen.
