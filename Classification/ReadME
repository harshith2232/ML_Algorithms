In machine learning and statistics, 
classification is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data input 
given to it and then uses this learning to classify new observation. 
This data set may simply be bi-class (like identifying whether the person is male or female or that the mail is spam or non-spam) 
or it may be multi-class too. 
Some examples of classification problems are: 
      speech recognition
      handwriting recognition
      bio metric identification
      document classification etc.
